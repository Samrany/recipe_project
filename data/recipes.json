		"directions": "Cut pork into 1/2-inch cubes and season with salt and pepper.Turn the Instant Pot on to the 'saute' function and add the olive oil. When the oil starts to shimmer and the pot is hot, add the pork and brown on all sides, about 2 minutes per side. (You might need to do this in two batches to prevent overcrowding.) Set browned pork on aside on a clean plate.With the Instant Pot still on the saute function, add your onions, garlic and cumin. Cook until onions begin to soften, about 4 minutes. When the onions are softened, hit the 'cancel/keep warm' button on the Instant Pot. Add the browned pork back into the pot along with the cumin, jar of green chiles, potatoes, chicken broth and bay leaf. Stir to combine. Secure the lid on your Instant Pot and make sure that the valve on the top is facing towards 'sealed'. Press the 'Meat/Stew' button and set the time to 35 minutes. Walk away from the InstantPot and let it do it's thing. When the cook time is complete, carefully release the pressure in the InstantPot by turning the valve to 'vent'. Once all the pressure is released and there is no more steam coming out of the InstantPot, carefully open the lid. You can either serve as is, or garnish as desired! Cilantro leaves, shredded cabbage and diced avocado all goes well on top of the soup-- but only if you have it around ðŸ˜‰ Enjoy!",

Then pour in non-dairy milk, and vanilla extract, and stir. 4. Pour the wet into the dry, and use a whisk to mix well. 5. Warm and grease a skillet on medium heat, then pour in your pancake batter. Cook pancakes on each side for about 3 minutes. Be very careful flipping these, because they donâ€™t have gluten they are more fragile. 6. Complete with the remaining batter. 7. Serve topped with sliced banana, blackberries, walnuts, cacao nibs, and maple syrup.",

		"directions": "1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F (180Â°C) and line a muffin tin with 12 paper liners. 2. Add the rolled oats to a high-speed blender and blend on high until a fine flour forms. Set aside. 3. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the ground chia seed and water until combined. Set aside for a few minutes to thicken. 4. To the same bowl, add the rest of the wet ingredients (pumpkin, oil, sugar, maple syrup, and vanilla) and stir until smooth. 5. Add the dry ingredients (oat flour, cocoa powder, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt) to the bowl with the wet ingredients. Whisk until smooth (I love using my big whisk for this task!). 6. Set aside 1/4 cup (45 g) of chocolate chips (if using) for the topping and stir the remaining chips into the batter. 7. Spoon the batter into the paper liners, filling each two-thirds full. Press the remaining chocolate chips into the tops of each muffin. 8. Bake the muffins for 20 to 25 minutes (I bake for 22), until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. 9. Place the muffin tin on a cooling rack for 10 minutes. Carefully remove each muffin and place it directly onto the cooling rack until fully cooled. Leftover muffins can be stored in the fridge in an airtight container for several days or frozen for up to 1 month.",
