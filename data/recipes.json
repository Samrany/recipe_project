When the oil starts to shimmer and the pot is hot, add the pork and brown on all sides, about 2 minutes per side. (You might need to do this in two batches to prevent overcrowding.) Set browned pork on aside on a clean plate.With the Instant Pot still on the saute function, add your onions, garlic and cumin. Cook until onions begin to soften, about 4 minutes. When the onions are softened, hit the 'cancel/keep warm' button on the Instant Pot. Add the browned pork back into the pot along with the cumin, jar of green chiles, potatoes, chicken broth and bay leaf. Stir to combine. Secure the lid on your Instant Pot and make sure that the valve on the top is facing towards 'sealed'. Press the 'Meat/Stew' button and set the time to 35 minutes. Walk away from the InstantPot and let it do it's thing. When the cook time is complete, carefully release the pressure in the InstantPot by turning the valve to 'vent'. Once all the pressure is released and there is no more steam coming out of the InstantPot, carefully open the lid. You can either serve as is, or garnish as desired! Cilantro leaves, shredded cabbage and diced avocado all goes well on top of the soup-- but only if you have it around üòâ Enjoy!",

		"directions": "Heat oven to 475¬∫F. Remove any damaged outer leaves of cabbage and cut it 8 (for small ones) to 12 (for a large one) wedges. Coat a large baking sheet with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Arrange cabbage wedges in one layer, drizzling or brushing them with 2 more tablespoons olive oil and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Roast for 8 to 10 minutes, until charred underneath (don‚Äôt panic if you see a few thin black edges; they‚Äôre going to taste amazing). Use a spatula to flip each piece over and roast for 5 more minutes, until the edges of the cabbage are dark brown. Meanwhile, while cabbage roasts, place nuts on a smaller tray or baking dish and roast them next to the cabbage for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove and scatter them, still hot, onto a cutting board and coarsely chop them. Scoop into a bowl and finely grate the zest of half a lemon and all of the garlic over it. Add remaning 3 tablespoons olive oil to walnuts, a few pinches of salt and red pepper flakes and stir to combine. If you‚Äôve got a couple minutes to let it all infuse as it cools, let it rest. When ready, squeeze the juice of half your lemon in and stir to combine. Adjust flavors to taste, adding more lemon if needed; you want this dressing to be robust. The moment the cabbage comes out of the oven, spoon the walnut dressing over the wedges. Grate parmesan all over, to taste. Serve immediately, while piping hot. There will be no leftovers.",
