When the oil starts to shimmer and the pot is hot, add the pork and brown on all sides, about 2 minutes per side. (You might need to do this in two batches to prevent overcrowding.) Set browned pork on aside on a clean plate.With the Instant Pot still on the saute function, add your onions, garlic and cumin. Cook until onions begin to soften, about 4 minutes. When the onions are softened, hit the 'cancel/keep warm' button on the Instant Pot. Add the browned pork back into the pot along with the cumin, jar of green chiles, potatoes, chicken broth and bay leaf. Stir to combine. Secure the lid on your Instant Pot and make sure that the valve on the top is facing towards 'sealed'. Press the 'Meat/Stew' button and set the time to 35 minutes. Walk away from the InstantPot and let it do it's thing. When the cook time is complete, carefully release the pressure in the InstantPot by turning the valve to 'vent'. Once all the pressure is released and there is no more steam coming out of the InstantPot, carefully open the lid. You can either serve as is, or garnish as desired! Cilantro leaves, shredded cabbage and diced avocado all goes well on top of the soup-- but only if you have it around 😉 Enjoy!",

To the same bowl, add the rest of the wet ingredients (pumpkin, oil, sugar, maple syrup, and vanilla) and stir until smooth. 5. Add the dry ingredients (oat flour, cocoa powder, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt) to the bowl with the wet ingredients. Whisk until smooth (I love using my big whisk for this task!). 6. Set aside 1/4 cup (45 g) of chocolate chips (if using) for the topping and stir the remaining chips into the batter. 7. Spoon the batter into the paper liners, filling each two-thirds full. Press the remaining chocolate chips into the tops of each muffin. 8. Bake the muffins for 20 to 25 minutes (I bake for 22), until a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean. 9. Place the muffin tin on a cooling rack for 10 minutes. Carefully remove each muffin and place it directly onto the cooling rack until fully cooled. Leftover muffins can be stored in the fridge in an airtight container for several days or frozen for up to 1 month.",

Season broth with additional salt or fish sauce to taste. Allow the broth to cool. Then strain the broth (it is easiest to remove large solids first and then strain) and return the broth to stock pot. Add the shredded chicken. Bring the broth to low simmer before serving. 5. While pho broth is initially cooking, fill another large pot with hot water. Bring to a boil and add the zucchini noodles. Quickly blanche the zucchini noodles for about 1-2 minutes, or until the noodles are nearly tender (they will cook a bit more when you serve them with the hot broth). Drain the zucchini noodles. 6.

Roast for 8 to 10 minutes, until charred underneath (don’t panic if you see a few thin black edges; they’re going to taste amazing). Use a spatula to flip each piece over and roast for 5 more minutes, until the edges of the cabbage are dark brown. Meanwhile, while cabbage roasts, place nuts on a smaller tray or baking dish and roast them next to the cabbage for 4 to 5 minutes. Remove and scatter them, still hot, onto a cutting board and coarsely chop them. Scoop into a bowl and finely grate the zest of half a lemon and all of the garlic over it. Add remaning 3 tablespoons olive oil to walnuts, a few pinches of salt and red pepper flakes and stir to combine. If you’ve got a couple minutes to let it all infuse as it cools, let it rest. When ready, squeeze the juice of half your lemon in and stir to combine. Adjust flavors to taste, adding more lemon if needed; you want this dressing to be robust. The moment the cabbage comes out of the oven, spoon the walnut dressing over the wedges. Grate parmesan all over, to taste. Serve immediately, while piping hot. There will be no leftovers.",
